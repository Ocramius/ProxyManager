## Tuning the ProxyManager for production

By default, all proxy factories generate the required proxy classes at runtime.

Proxy generation causes I/O operations and uses a lot of reflection, so be sure to have
generated all of your proxies **before deploying your code on a live system**, or you
may experience poor performance.

You can configure ProxyManager so that it will try autoloading the proxies first.
Generating them "bulk" is not yet implemented:

```php
$config = new \ProxyManager\Configuration();
$config->setProxiesTargetDir(__DIR__ . '/my/generated/classes/cache/dir');

// then register the autoloader
spl_autoload_register($config->getProxyAutoloader());
```

Generating a classmap with all your proxy classes in it will also work perfectly.

Please note that all the currently implemented `ProxyManager\Factory\*` classes accept
a `ProxyManager\Configuration` object as optional constructor parameter. This allows for
fine-tuning of ProxyManager according to your needs.
