## Proxy example

Here's how you build a lazy loadable object with ProxyManager using a *Virtual Proxy*

```php
$factory = new \ProxyManager\Factory\LazyLoadingValueHolderFactory();

$proxy = $factory->createProxy(
    \MyApp\HeavyComplexObject::class,
    function (& $wrappedObject, $proxy, $method, $parameters, & $initializer) {
        $wrappedObject = new \MyApp\HeavyComplexObject(); // instantiation logic here
        $initializer   = null; // turning off further lazy initialization

        return true; // report success
    }
);

$proxy->doFoo();
```

See the [documentation](docs) for more supported proxy types and examples.
