## Installation

The suggested installation method is via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
php composer.phar require ocramius/proxy-manager:1.0.*
```

## Proxy example

Here's how you build a lazy loadable object with ProxyManager using a *Virtual Proxy*

```php
$factory = new \ProxyManager\Factory\LazyLoadingValueHolderFactory();

$proxy = $factory->createProxy(
    'MyApp\HeavyComplexObject',
    function (& $wrappedObject, $proxy, $method, $parameters, & $initializer) {
        $wrappedObject = new HeavyComplexObject(); // instantiation logic here
        $initializer   = null; // turning off further lazy initialization
    }
);

$proxy->doFoo();
```

See the [online documentation](http://ocramius.github.io/ProxyManager) for more supported proxy types and examples.
